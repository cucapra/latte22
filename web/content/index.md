LATTE '22 is a workshop co-located with [ASPLOS '22][asplos-22]. For examples
of previously presented papers, take a look at [LATTE '21][latte-21].

> LATTE is going to offer a hybrid attendance model. Participants will be able to attend either remotely or in-person. Table and plenary discussions will both use hybrid modality.
